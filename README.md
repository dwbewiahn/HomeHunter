# HomeHunter - Advanced Apartment Search Application

HomeHunter is a sophisticated web application designed to streamline and enhance the process of searching for apartments. The application empowers users to establish custom search filters and promptly notifies them when a new apartment that aligns with their filters is listed.

This project is a key component of the Project Factory course unit, a part of the Computer Engineering program at IADE. The project is being developed under the expert guidance of Professor FÃ¡bio Guilherme.
